i. Instructions to setup your app

iii. Brief explanation of what technologies you used and how you accomplished your 
application (donâ€™t spend too much time on this)

We used Node.js to create this application. mysql2 allows us to communicate with the sql server and run our stored procedures.
Node.js allows us to create html pages as well as make get and post requests so we can navigate the pages as well as interact with the database.

Allison - Node.js set up as well as half of the pages

Gabriel - 1/4th of the pages

Jason - 1/4th of the pages
